Title: Buffy vs. Vampires

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is on a mission to slay as many vampires as she can. Your job is to write a function to help her. 

Each vampire has a different strength represented by the length of their name. Buffy needs one stake per letter in the vampire's name to defeat them. 

Your function should take in a vampire's name as a string and return the number of stakes Buffy needs to defeat them.
