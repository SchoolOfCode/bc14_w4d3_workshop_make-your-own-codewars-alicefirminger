Title: 👱🏼‍♀️ Buffy vs. Vampires 🧛🏻

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is on a mission to slay as many vampires as she can. Your job is to write a function to help her. 

Each vampire has a different strength represented by the length of their name. Buffy needs one stake per letter in the vampire's name to defeat them. 

Your function should take in a vampire's name as a string and return the number of stakes Buffy needs to defeat them. Try to find out how many stakes Buffy needs in total to defeat all the vampires. Happy slaying!




HINT: Your function should be able to check both the number of letters in an individual string AND in an array of strings.
